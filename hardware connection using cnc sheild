the materials : 

CNC shield 
DRV8825
Stepper motor Nema 17
moblie battery 12v 

the connection : 

The CNC Shield is basically work as an Arduino UNO Shield that used for powering up and driving stepper motors.
This CNC shield has 4 motor spots, each spot is mainly for each axis (X, Y, Z AND A) each motor can be connecting to each axis or it can be used one motor that give the three axis . It requires a 12V to 36V power supply
so i used a 12 v power supply ( old mobile battery ) and easy running of a CNC shield a DRV8825 motor compatible with V3 has been used
Now, beside each driver there are 4 spots where the stepper motors Nema 17 can be plugged , since i have one stepper motor nema 17 ,so i used one spot . 
for the battery 
there is blue box on the CNC shield represents the  battery spots     the + and â€“  represents the direction  where the  battery cables  connected to it 





i have use an alternative software to control the cnc sheild and the nema 17 which is Estlcam software : see the Estlcam.doc  and hardware build connection video for more information .
