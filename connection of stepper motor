L298D driver 




the connection of the circuit as follow : 

In H bridge motor driver 

connect the vcc1 with pin 1,2 EN and vcc2 with pin 3,4 EN .
Then connect them together 
Connect the ground pins together in each side then connect the both sides together .
Connect the the enable ground  in motor with the output 3 pin in L298D 
Connect the channel b in the motor with the output 4 pin in L298D 
Connect the channel a in the  with the output 2 pin in L298D 
Connect the the enable power in the  motor with the output 1 pin in L298D  . 

In Arduino uno  
The 8,9,10,11 pins to pin 1,2 EN of L298D
Pin 9  to output 3 pin of L298D

The battery 
The positive to motor positive 
The negative to motor negative
